CRISPR : Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats , is a bacterial immune system that has been modified for genome engineering.

The name, while long tells a lot about the CRISPR system. "Repeats", like the name implies are "short" repeats of DNA segments typically about 20 - 40 letters in length. There also "Palindromic", meaning that the sequence of letters can be read the same both left to right or right to left. 

Now these "repeats" are "interspaced". In between these repeats we have what's called spacer DNA. Unlike the repeats, spacer DNA is not identical, each spacer is unique. These spacer segments are actually viral \ bacteriophage DNA.

There are also CRISPR Associated genes called CAS genes. These genes code for CAS proteins mainly helicases (used to unzip or unwind DNA) 
and nucleases (which cut DNA).

The theory is that bacterium like E.Coli use the CRISPR as an immune system response against foreign threats like viruses. Essentially, what happens is that CAS complex will find use a matching segment in the DNA and used it, this is called the CRISPR RNA. When the complex finds the matching DNA, it simply just destroy's it and the threat is removed.

If, on the other hand the viral RNA does not match with anything in the bacteria's DNA, the CRISPR system will create a different protein, a class I CAS protein. This system, very simply, takes the RNA breaks it apart and and copies it into the CRISPR system. The spacer, for the bacteria, is basically history of viral infections. 

This system, researched by two OG's, Jennifier Doudna and Emmanuel Charpenter, was researched and it was found that the CAS9 protein complex could be used to essentially just cut DNA segments. 

Once cut the body tries to do a couple of things, either it will add mutations into the the cut space, combine the
